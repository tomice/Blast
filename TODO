TODO
* Show controls during launch instead of simply in the README
* Add controller support. Maybe this: https://github.com/joncoop/pygame-xbox360controller
* Add error handling because this is a bit amateur hour...
* Add tests because, again, amateur hour
* Fix clipping on lives and the enemy sprite
* Add a better background
* Add barriers akin to Space Invaders
* Add other enemies and bosses
* Add scoreboard complete with names of players. Nosql DB maybe?
