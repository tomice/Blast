TODO
* Show controls during launch instead of simply in the README
* Add controller support. 
  - Maybe this: https://github.com/joncoop/pygame-xbox360controller
* Add error handling because this is a bit amateur hour...
* Add tests because, again, amateur hour
* Fix clipping on lives and the enemy sprite with regards to the top text
* Add barriers akin to Space Invaders
* Add other enemies and bosses
* Add scoreboard complete with names of players. Nosql DB maybe?
* Image blitting can possibly be done better. BG can be a surface?
* Improve high score and other assets by encrypting them into binary chunks? 
  - Is this possible with pygame? Research...
* Fix audio glitch when music loops
* Fix the intro music hack. There should be a better way to do this than having a large, looping audio file
